# TypeScript
This TypeScript demonstration project was created using Visual Studio Code 1.47.1, .NET Core 3.1.301, TypeScript 3.9.6, and Node v14.5.0.  The objective is to demonstrate TypeScript functionality and execute compiled JavaScript from the command line.

## Commands
The executed commands performed in the animated GIF are as follows:
> environment version list & execute
```shell
> dotnet --version
> tsc --version
> node --version
> node out/interfaceDemo
```
> NOTE: Running tsc locally will compile the closest project defined by a tsconfig.json file.
